Step 1: Get it scraping(not when I want it to, and then saves all to DB????)

Step 2: push scraped data to MongoDB (**need to do** 20 at a time)
this works just not how i want

Step 3: Display MongoDB data onto page
-this works


Step 4: grab articles to write comments on specific one
this works


Step 5: Display article with comments
I have the JSON just dont know how to get it??


Step 6: Delete Comment
-no idea how to do?

Step:7  Delete Article
-only way I know how is through CLI
-how to I put into code?

Each time i scrape articles are saved to DB(over and over again_, (how do i limit to 20?)
button does not work, then all articles scraped appear on page and have to delete collection 'articles'
to be able to test scrape button
then HW asks us to save specific articles after they have already been saved?

How do i display comments for a specific article?
-need to delete comments on that article 
-need to delete Article itself


How do i delete comments from a specific article?


Whenever a user visits your site, the app should scrape stories from a news outlet of your choice and display them for the user. 
Each scraped article should be saved to your application database.
