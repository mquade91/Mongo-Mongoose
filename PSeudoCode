What Works:
-App can scrape (user must 1st go to "/scrape" then return to "/"
-App can GET "saved articles" by clicking "get saved articles" button
-App allows user to comment on Articles by clicking on any Article (<p>)
-User can GET ARTICLES and view if they have comments
    -if article has comments go to "/articles/:id" to view in JSON
-User can GET ALL Articles in JSON by going to "/articles"


Things to do:
